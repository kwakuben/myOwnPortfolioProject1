# myOwnPortfolioProject1
This repo houses how I built from scratch a portfolio website using raw HTML5, CSS (SASS) and JavaScript. It is based on a tutorial by MacLinz published on
freeCodeCamp's platform.

Typically most developers design and build websites using no-code platforms. This simplifies the development experience massively. 
However, for a newbie web developer just starting off, it is best to start from blank files and slowly work your way upwards until you get the completed 
site. This approach exposes you to the full development practice, forces you to understand what is really going on under the hood most times, and even helps
become a productive developer.

As a junior developer, I embarked on this project for the above-mentioned reasons and more. After completing the task in a few days, I still feel it was super worth it, 
and my reason are simple: it aided my experience in front-end  development
